# Reset Password

## Feature Overview

When you have forgotten your Rune Console login password, you can reset it via email or phone number verification. The reset process confirms your identity by sending a verification code to the email or phone number you registered with. After verification, you can set a new password. Once the reset is successful, all existing login sessions will be immediately invalidated, and you will need to log in again with the new password.

## Access Path

- Login page → Click the "Forgot Password?" link
- Direct URL: `https://your-domain/console/auth/reset-password`

## Page Description

![Reset Password Page](/screenshots/console/reset-password.png)

The reset password page uses a step-by-step form design, requiring you to complete two steps in sequence: identity verification and password setting.

### Step 1: Identity Verification

First, you need to verify your identity to confirm you are the legitimate owner of the account.

![Identity Verification Step](/screenshots/console/reset-password-step1.png)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Email/Phone Number | Text input | ✅ | Enter the email address or phone number bound during registration |
| Verification Code | Text input | ✅ | Enter the 6-digit verification code you received |

**Verification Code Sending Process:**

1. Enter the email address or phone number used during registration in the input field
2. Click the **Send Verification Code** button on the right
3. The system calls the `POST /api/iam/send-code` endpoint to send a verification code to the target email/phone
4. The button enters a **60-second countdown**; you cannot resend during the countdown
5. Check your email inbox (or phone messages) to retrieve the 6-digit verification code
6. Enter the received verification code in the verification code input field

> 💡 Tip: If using email to receive the verification code, also check your spam/junk mail folder. The verification code email sender is typically the platform's configured system email address.

> ⚠️ Note: The verification code is valid for approximately **5 minutes**. Please complete the subsequent steps promptly after receiving the code. If the code has expired, click "Resend" to get a new one.

### Step 2: Set New Password

After identity verification passes, you'll enter the new password setup page.

| Field | Type | Required | Validation Rules | Description |
|-------|------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| New Password | Password input | ✅ | At least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers | Set your new login password |
| Confirm Password | Password input | ✅ | Must exactly match the new password | Re-enter the new password to confirm |

**New Password Requirements:**

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Minimum length | At least **8** characters |
| Uppercase letter | At least **1** uppercase letter (A-Z) |
| Lowercase letter | At least **1** lowercase letter (a-z) |
| Number | At least **1** number (0-9) |
| Password history | The new password cannot be the same as a recently used password |

> ⚠️ Note: A password strength indicator bar is provided next to the password input field. We recommend setting a password with "Strong" strength to ensure account security.

## Steps

## Effects After Successful Reset

After a successful password reset, the following take effect:

1. **All sessions immediately invalidated**: Your login status on all devices and browsers will be cleared
2. **All Tokens invalidated**: Previously issued JWT Tokens (both Access Token and Refresh Token) will all become invalid
3. **Re-login required**: You need to log in again with the new password on all devices
4. **MFA unaffected**: If you have MFA enabled, the MFA binding is not affected by the password reset
5. **API Keys unaffected**: Existing API Keys will not be invalidated by the password reset

> 💡 Tip: If you suspect your account has been compromised, after resetting the password we recommend also reviewing and updating your MFA settings and API Keys.

## Common Error Messages

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Email not registered | The entered email address is not in the system | Verify the email address is correct, or try another email used during registration |
| Verification code error | The entered code does not match the one sent | Carefully verify the code from the email/SMS |
| Verification code expired | The code has exceeded its 5-minute validity period | Click "Resend" to get a new verification code |
| New password cannot be the same as old password | The new password duplicates a recently used password | Set a password that has not been used before |
| Insufficient password strength | The password does not meet complexity requirements | Increase password length or add missing character types |
| Passwords do not match | The confirm password does not match the new password | Re-enter the confirm password |
| Verification code sent too frequently | Multiple code requests in a short period | Wait for the 60-second countdown to finish before trying again |

## Unable to Receive Verification Code

If you cannot receive a verification code through your registered email or phone number, here are possible causes and solutions:

### Email Unavailable

- **Email deactivated**: If the registered email account has been cancelled or deactivated, you will be unable to receive the verification code
- **Corporate email reclaimed**: After leaving a company, the corporate email may have been reclaimed
- **Solution**: Contact the system administrator to reset your password directly through the admin panel

### Phone Number Changed

- **Number cancelled**: The original phone number has been reclaimed by the carrier
- **Number transferred**: The phone number has been transferred to another person
- **Solution**: Contact the system administrator, provide identity verification, and have the administrator assist with the reset

### Verification Email Blocked

- Check your spam/junk mail folder
- Add the system email sender address to your whitelist
- Contact your IT department to confirm whether the corporate email gateway is blocking verification code emails

> 💡 Tip: If none of the above methods resolve the issue, please contact the system administrator. Administrators can directly reset your password in the BOSS admin's User Management without requiring a verification code.

## Security Recommendations

- After resetting your password, we recommend logging in on all commonly used devices to confirm the new password works
- Check your account's login history after resetting the password to confirm there are no suspicious login records
- If you reset your password due to a suspected account breach, we also recommend enabling [MFA](./mfa.md) for enhanced security
- Do not use the same password as other platforms
- We recommend using a password manager to securely store passwords

## Important Notes

- Verification codes are valid for approximately 5 minutes; please use them promptly after receiving
- The new password cannot be the same as recently used passwords
- All existing login sessions will be immediately invalidated after a successful reset
- You cannot resend a verification code within 60 seconds
- Multiple incorrect verification code entries may trigger security restrictions, requiring you to wait a period before trying again
