# Roles and Permissions

## Feature Overview

Rune Console employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. The platform comes with four predefined roles, each with different permission scopes and operable resources. On the front-end, permissions manifest as navigation menu visibility, UI element visibility, and action button enabling/disabling. However, the actual security control is always enforced by the back-end API — even if front-end restrictions are bypassed to call the API directly, unauthorized requests will still be rejected.

### Three-Level Permission Scope

The Rune Console permission system is divided into three tiers, progressively narrowing from top to bottom:

        SysRes["Manage clusters, resource pools, flavors<br/>Manage all tenants<br/>Platform config, LLM Gateway"]
    end
    subgraph Tenant["Tenant Level"]
        TA2["Tenant Admin"]
        TenRes["Manage workspaces, members, quotas<br/>Manage all resources within the tenant"]
    end
    subgraph Workspace["Workspace Level"]
        DEV2["Developer / Member"]
        WsRes["Manage/view instances, images<br/>Dev environments, inference services"]
    end

```

| Scope | Description | Roles Involved |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **System Level** | Entire platform scope, across all tenants | System Admin |
| **Tenant Level** | Within a single tenant | Tenant Admin |
| **Workspace Level** | Within a single workspace | Developer, Member |

> 💡 Tip: Higher-level roles automatically inherit all permissions of lower levels. For example, a Tenant Admin has all Developer and Member permissions within their tenant scope.

## Detailed Role Descriptions

### System Admin

- **Scope**: Entire platform (system level)
- **Permission Range**: `*:*` (all operations on all resources)
- **Access Interface**: Console + BOSS

The System Admin is the platform's super user with full access to all features.

**Available Operations:**

| Operation Category | Specific Operations |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Cluster Management | Add/edit/delete compute clusters, view cluster status and monitoring |
| Resource Pool Management | Create/configure resource pools, allocate resources to tenants |
| Flavor Management | Define instance flavors (GPU type, memory, CPU, etc.) |
| Tenant Management | Create/disable/delete tenants, approve tenant registrations, allocate quotas |
| User Management | Manage all platform users, reset passwords, reset MFA |
| System Templates | Manage system-level image templates (available to all tenants) |
| LLM Gateway | Configure model gateway, API Keys, audit logs, content moderation |
| Platform Configuration | Login policies, registration policies, MFA policies, platform theme |
| System Images | Manage system-preset images |
| App Market | Manage applications in the system-level app market |

**Example Operations:**

```
# Example operations a System Admin can perform

> 💡 Tip: The Member role is suitable for personnel who need to view project progress but do not need to directly operate resources, such as project managers, product managers, and auditors.

## Role Comparison Overview

The following table summarizes the permission comparison across the four roles for each resource:

| Resource | Operation | System Admin | Tenant Admin | Developer | Member |
|----------|-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:------:|

## Permission Expression Format

Rune Console uses a concise text format to express permissions:

```
[service:]<resource>:<action>
```

### Format Description

| Part | Required | Description | Example |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `service` | Optional | Service prefix to distinguish different microservices | `compute`, `gateway` |
| `resource` | Required | Resource type | `instance`, `workspace`, `member` |
| `action` | Required | Operation type | `create`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `delete` |

### Permission Expression Examples

```
# Basic format
instance:create          → Create instance
workspace:list           → List workspaces
member:delete            → Delete member

# With service prefix
compute:instance:create  → Create instance in compute service
gateway:config:update    → Update configuration in gateway service

# Wildcards
instance:*               → All operations on instances
*:*                      → All operations on all resources
workspace:list/get       → List and view workspaces
```

### Wildcard Matching Rules

Permission validation uses wildcard matching:

| Expression | Match Scope | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `*:*` | All operations on all resources | System Admin permissions |
| `instance:*` | All operations on instances | Includes create, list, get, update, delete, etc. |
| `workspace:list/get` | List and view workspaces | Multiple actions separated by `/` |

Validation logic: When a user performs an operation, the system checks whether the user role's permission list contains a matching expression. Matching rules:

1. Exact match: `instance:create` matches `instance:create` ✅
2. Resource wildcard: `instance:*` matches `instance:create` ✅
3. Full wildcard: `*:*` matches any permission expression ✅
4. No match: `instance:list` does not match `instance:create` ❌

## Front-end Permission Control Mechanism

Rune Console implements multi-layered permission control on the front-end, filtering from top to bottom to ensure different roles see the appropriate interface:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["PermissionProvider<br/>(Permission Data Loading)"] --> B["RouteGuard<br/>(Page-level Route Guard)"]
    B --> C["&lt;Authorized&gt; Component<br/>(UI Element-level Control)"]
    C --> D["usePermission Hook<br/>(Programmatic Permission Check)"]

    A1["Load user permission list after login<br/>Store in React Context"] --> A
    B1["Check on route navigation<br/>Show 403 page if unauthorized"] --> B
    C1["Wrap buttons/areas<br/>Hide or disable if unauthorized"] --> C
    D1["Dynamically check permissions<br/>in code logic"] --> D

    style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style B fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00
    style C fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style D fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c62828
```

### 1. PermissionProvider (Permission Data Layer)

- After user login, the system retrieves the current user's roles and permission list
- Permission data is shared across the entire application via React Context
- Permissions are automatically reloaded when switching tenants or workspaces

### 2. RouteGuard (Page-level Route Guard)

- Each route can be configured with required permissions
- When a user navigates to a page, the RouteGuard checks whether they have the corresponding permission
- Unauthorized access shows a 403 Forbidden page instead of a blank page or error
- Example: Accessing the "Member Management" page requires `member:list` permission

### 3. `<Authorized>` Component (UI Element-level Control)

- Used to wrap UI elements that require permission control (buttons, menu items, action areas, etc.)
- When unauthorized, the element can either be hidden or set to a disabled state
- Example: The "Create Instance" button is only visible to users with `instance:create` permission

### 4. `usePermission` Hook (Programmatic Permission Check)

- Checks whether the user has a specific permission via code within component logic
- Returns a boolean value for conditional rendering and logic branching
- Example: `const canCreate = usePermission('instance:create')`

> ⚠️ Note: Front-end permission control is purely a UI experience optimization to prevent users from seeing buttons or pages they cannot operate. Actual security control is always enforced by the back-end API — even if front-end code is tampered with, the back-end will still reject unauthorized requests.

### Navigation Menu Filtering

The left navigation bar automatically filters visible menu items based on user role:

| Menu Item | System Admin | Tenant Admin | Developer | Member |
|-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Overview / Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Inference Services | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Fine-tuning Services | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dev Environments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Apps | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Experiments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Evaluations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| App Market | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Log Viewer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Member Management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Workspace Management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Quota Management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| BOSS Admin | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Role Assignment and Changes

### Who Can Assign Roles

| Operation | Roles That Can Execute |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Assign/change System Admin | System Admin |
| Assign/change Tenant Admin | System Admin, Tenant Admin |
| Assign/change Developer | Tenant Admin |
| Assign/change Member | Tenant Admin |

### How to Change User Roles

**Tenant Admin adjusting member roles within the tenant:**

1. Go to Console → Member Management
2. Find the target user
3. Click the "Edit" button
4. Select the new role from the role dropdown
5. Click "Save"

**System Admin adjusting system roles:**

1. Go to BOSS → User Management
2. Find the target user
3. Edit the user role

### Role Changes Take Effect

When role changes take effect:

- If the user is currently online, the permission change does not take effect immediately
- The user needs to **refresh the page** or **re-login** for the new permissions to load
- We recommend notifying the user to refresh the page after changing important permissions

## Permission Refresh Timing

The following scenarios trigger a re-fetch of permission data:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| After user login | Initial permission data is loaded upon successful login |
| When switching tenants | You may have different roles in different tenants |
| When switching workspaces | Workspace-level may have additional permission configurations |
| After role change | An administrator has changed your role (requires page refresh) |
| Manual page refresh | Browser refresh re-fetches permission data |

## Practical Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: AI Team Daily Usage

- **Zhang San** (Tenant Admin): Creates workspaces "Model Training" and "Inference Deployment", invites team members, allocates GPU quotas
- **Li Si** (Developer): Creates fine-tuning tasks in the "Model Training" workspace, deploys inference services
- **Wang Wu** (Developer): Manages inference instances in the "Inference Deployment" workspace, debugs dev environments
- **Zhao Liu** (Member — Product Manager): Views instance status and usage across workspaces

### Scenario 2: Multi-Tenant Management

- **Admin A** (System Admin): Creates tenants "R&D Department" and "Product Department", allocates cluster resources
- **Admin B** (Tenant Admin — R&D Dept): Manages the R&D Department's workspaces and members
- **Admin C** (Tenant Admin — Product Dept): Manages the Product Department's workspaces and members
- **Developer D**: Belongs to both "R&D Department" (Developer role) and "Product Department" (Member role)

> 💡 Tip: A single user can have different roles in different tenants. When switching tenants, the interface automatically adjusts based on your role in the target tenant.

## Important Notes

- Front-end permissions are purely UI experience optimizations; actual security is enforced by the back-end API
- If you notice permission anomalies, try refreshing the page or re-logging in to reload permissions
- Contact the corresponding tenant administrator or system administrator for higher permissions
- Role changes require a page refresh or re-login to take effect
- The System Admin role should be assigned carefully; we recommend enabling MFA for enhanced security
