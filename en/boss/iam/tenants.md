# Tenant Management

## Feature Overview

A Tenant is the **organizational isolation unit** of the Rune platform and serves as the foundational boundary for resource allocation, permission management, and billing. Each tenant has its own member system, resource quotas, and workspaces. System administrators manage the full lifecycle of all tenants through the BOSS Tenant Management module, including **creating tenants**, **editing information**, **managing members**, **enabling/disabling**, and more.

## Access Path

BOSS → Account Center → **Tenant Management**

Path: `/boss/iam/tenants`

## Tenant Lifecycle

### Post-Creation Actions

After successful tenant creation, the system will display a **follow-up action guide** with three quick options:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["✅ Tenant Created Successfully"] --> B{"Choose Next Action"}
    B --> C["📦 Allocate Quota<br/>Assign compute resources to tenant"]
    B --> D["👥 Add Members<br/>Invite users to join tenant"]
    B --> E["↩️ Return to List<br/>Configure later"]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Allocate Quota** | Navigate to tenant resources page to allocate CPU / GPU / memory quotas for the new tenant |
| **Add Members** | Navigate to tenant member management page to invite users and assign roles |
| **Return to List** | Return to the tenant list page for later configuration |

> 💡 Tip: Newly created tenants have no resource quotas or members by default. It is recommended to immediately allocate quotas and add at least one tenant administrator after creation, otherwise tenant members will be unable to use any compute resources.

### Corresponding API

```
POST /api/iam/tenant-register
```

---

## Edit Tenant

### Steps

1. Find the target tenant in the tenant list
2. Click the **Edit** button on that tenant's row
3. Modify information in the popup edit form
4. Click the **Save** button to submit changes

### Editable Fields

| Field | Editable | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Avatar** | ✅ | Can re-upload and crop avatar |
| **Tenant ID** | ❌ Not editable | Locked after creation |
| **Email** | ✅ | Can modify administrative contact email |
| **Phone** | ✅ | Can modify administrative contact phone |
| **Description** | ✅ | Can modify tenant description |

### Avatar Update API

```
PUT /api/iam/tenants/:id/avatar
```

> ⚠️ Note: The Tenant ID is the tenant's unique identifier. Once set at creation time, it cannot be changed. To change the Tenant ID, the tenant must be deleted and recreated, which will result in the loss of all member relationships and resource allocations under the original tenant.

---

## Enable / Disable Tenant

Administrators can temporarily disable a tenant. After disabling, all members under that tenant will be unable to access the tenant's resources.

| Operation | Effect | Corresponding API |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Disable** | All members under the tenant cannot access tenant resources; in-progress tasks are not affected | `PUT /api/iam/tenants/:id/disable` |
| **Enable** | Restore tenant access permissions | `PUT /api/iam/tenants/:id/enable` |

> ⚠️ Note: In the current version, the tenant enable/disable feature is **under development**, and the corresponding buttons may not yet be displayed in the interface. This feature will be officially available in a future version.

---

## Tenant Detail Page

Click the tenant name to enter the tenant detail page. The detail page uses a multi-area layout to display comprehensive tenant information.

Path: `/boss/iam/tenants/:id`

![Tenant Detail Page](/screenshots/boss/iam-tenants-detail.png)

### Page Layout

The detail page is divided into three main areas:

        direction TB
        subgraph Upper["Upper Area"]
            TenantInfo["📋 Tenant Info<br/>3 Columns<br/>Basic Information"]
            MemberStats["📊 Member Statistics<br/>Statistical Charts"]
        end
        subgraph Lower["Lower Area"]
            Members["👥 Tenant Member List<br/>9 Columns<br/>Member Table"]
        end
    end
```

### Tenant Info Area (TenantInfo)

| Tenant Name | Tenant display name |
| Tenant ID | Tenant unique identifier |
| Email | Administrative contact email |
| Phone | Administrative contact phone |

| Column | Field Name | Display | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | `name` | Avatar + Display Name | Member's username, with avatar icon |
| **Email** | `email` | Text | Member's registered email |

| **Actions** | — | Action Buttons | Edit Role, Remove Member |

---

## Tenant Member Management

Path: `/boss/iam/tenants/:id/members`

![Tenant Member Management](/screenshots/boss/iam-tenants-members.png)

### Add Member

1. In the member list area of the tenant detail page, click the **Add Member** button
2. Search for and select the user to add in the popup dialog
3. Assign a role within that tenant for the user
4. Click **Confirm** to complete the addition

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| User | Search and select from the platform user list; supports search by username or email |
| Role | Select the user's role within the tenant (e.g., Tenant Administrator, Regular Member) |

> 💡 Tip: A user can belong to multiple tenants simultaneously and can have different roles in different tenants.

### Edit Member Role

1. Find the target member in the member list
2. Click the **Edit Role** button
3. Modify the role in the popup selection box
4. Click **Save** to confirm changes

2. Click the **Delete** button

## Best Practices

### Tenant Planning Recommendations

- **Organize tenants by organizational structure**: It is recommended that each department or team corresponds to one tenant, avoiding cross-department tenant sharing that leads to resource and permission confusion
- **Set quotas reasonably**: Allocate resource quotas based on actual team needs, avoiding over-allocation that wastes resources or under-allocation that hinders usage
- **Designate multiple administrators**: Each tenant should have at least 2 administrators to avoid losing tenant management when a single administrator leaves

### Naming Conventions

- Tenant IDs should use meaningful abbreviations, such as `team-ai-research`, `dept-engineering`
- Maintain consistent naming styles for ease of management and lookup

### Security Recommendations

1. **Regularly review the member list** and remove members who no longer need access
2. **Use the principle of least privilege**, granting only necessary roles
3. **Monitor quota usage** and adjust promptly to avoid resource shortages or waste
