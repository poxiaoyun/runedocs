# Cluster Management

## Feature Overview

Cluster Management is the most critical infrastructure management feature in BOSS. All computing power on the Rune platform comes from Kubernetes clusters connected through BOSS. System administrators can perform full lifecycle management of clusters here, including **adding clusters**, **connection testing**, **publishing**, **detail monitoring**, and **terminal operations**.

Each cluster contains **13 detail subpages**, covering everything from node management, resource pools, and flavor configuration to monitoring metrics, log queries, and event tracking — serving as the core entry point for infrastructure operations.

## Access Path

BOSS → Rune → **Cluster Management**

Path: `/boss/rune/clusters`

```

---

## Add Cluster

![Add Cluster Form](/screenshots/boss/rune-clusters-create.png)

### Steps

1. On the cluster list page, click the **Add Cluster** button in the upper right corner
2. Fill in the cluster information in the popup form
3. It's recommended to click **Test Connection** first to confirm the configuration is correct
4. Click the **Create** button to complete the addition

### Form Fields

| Field | Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Cluster ID** | `id` | IdField | ✅ | Unique cluster identifier, cannot be modified after creation. Recommend using meaningful short identifiers like `prod-gpu-01` |
| **Cluster Name** | `name` | Text Input | ✅ | Display name for the cluster, used in the UI |
| **Description** | `description` | Textarea (4 rows) | — | Supplementary description, such as purpose, location, etc. |
| **Cluster Type** | `type` | Fixed Value | — | Fixed as **Kubernetes** (currently only K8s clusters are supported) |
| **KubeConfig** | `kube.config` | Textarea (8 rows, monospace) | ✅ | Kubernetes cluster connection configuration, i.e., kubeconfig YAML content |

### KubeConfig Configuration

KubeConfig is the core configuration for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster and must contain the following key information:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
  - cluster:
      server: https://your-k8s-api-server:6443
      certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-ca-cert>
    name: my-cluster
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: my-cluster
      user: admin
    name: my-context
current-context: my-context
users:
  - name: admin
    user:
      client-certificate-data: <base64-encoded-cert>
      client-key-data: <base64-encoded-key>
```

> ⚠️ Note: The certificates and keys in KubeConfig are highly sensitive information. Please ensure:
> - Use a dedicated service account, not a personal account
> - Grant minimum necessary permissions
> - Do not transmit KubeConfig content through insecure channels

---

## Test Connection (Dry-Run)

When creating or editing a cluster, you can verify the KubeConfig configuration through the **Test Connection** feature.

### How to Use

1. Fill in the KubeConfig in the cluster create/edit form
2. Click the **Test Connection** button
3. The system will attempt to connect to the cluster in Dry-Run mode
4. The connection test result is displayed

### Test Results

| Result | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Connection Successful | Success | KubeConfig is valid, cluster API can be accessed normally |
| ❌ Connection Failed | Failed | Error information displayed, such as expired certificate, unreachable address, etc. |
| ⚠️ Partially Available | Warning | Connectable but insufficient permissions, recommend checking RBAC configuration |

> 💡 Tip: It is strongly recommended to perform a connection test before creating a cluster. If you skip the test and create directly, the cluster may be in an Error state, requiring subsequent KubeConfig modifications to reconnect.

---

## Publish / Unpublish

A cluster's **publish status** determines whether it is visible to tenants and available for resource allocation.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Publish** | Cluster becomes visible to tenants; tenant administrators can allocate resources and deploy instances on it |
| **Unpublish** | Cluster is hidden from tenants; already deployed instances are not affected, but new deployments are not allowed |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Newly Added Cluster<br/>Unpublished State"] --> B{"Admin Action"}
    B -->|Publish| C["Published<br/>Visible & Available to Tenants"]
    B -->|Don't Publish Yet| D["Unpublished<br/>Visible to Admins Only"]
    C --> E{"Admin Action"}
    E -->|Unpublish| D
    D --> F{"Admin Action"}
    F -->|Publish| C
```

> 💡 Tip: It is recommended to publish new clusters only after completing connection testing, resource pool configuration, and flavor setup, to avoid tenants seeing clusters that are not yet ready.

---

## kubectl Terminal

BOSS provides a built-in **kubectl terminal** feature that allows administrators to execute kubectl commands directly in the browser against a cluster, without needing to configure kubeconfig locally.

![kubectl Terminal](/screenshots/boss/rune-clusters-terminal.png)

### How to Use

1. In the cluster list, click the **Terminal** button in the target cluster's action column
2. The system opens a web terminal at the bottom of the page or in a new window
3. The terminal is automatically configured with the target cluster's connection context
4. You can directly execute `kubectl` commands

### Common Command Examples

```bash
# Check cluster node status
kubectl get nodes

# View pods across all namespaces
kubectl get pods -A

# Check cluster resource usage
kubectl top nodes

# View events in a specific namespace
kubectl get events -n rune-system
```

> ⚠️ Note: Commands executed in the terminal have cluster administrator privileges. Please operate with caution. Avoid executing destructive commands (such as `kubectl delete`) on production clusters; test on test clusters first.

---

## Edit Cluster

1. Click the **Edit** button in the action column of the cluster list
2. You can modify the cluster name, description, and KubeConfig
3. After modifying KubeConfig, it is recommended to perform a connection test again
4. Click **Save** to submit the changes

> 💡 Tip: Cluster ID and type cannot be modified after creation. To switch clusters, it is recommended to create a new cluster, migrate resources, then delete the old cluster.

---

## Delete Cluster

1. Click the **Delete** button in the action column of the cluster list
2. The system displays a confirmation dialog
3. Confirm to execute the deletion

> ⚠️ Note: Deleting a cluster is an **irreversible** operation. Before deletion, please ensure:
> - No running instances on the cluster
> - All important data has been migrated
> - All tenants using the cluster have been notified
> - All resource pools and quotas associated with the cluster have been released

---

## Best Practices

### Cluster Planning Recommendations

- **Separate production and test**: It is recommended to connect separate production and test clusters to avoid test tasks affecting production workloads
- **Partition by resource type**: GPU-intensive and CPU-intensive workloads should use different clusters
- **Reserve resource headroom**: Cluster resource usage should be kept below 80%, reserving capacity for burst demand

### KubeConfig Security

1. Use a **dedicated service account** to connect to clusters, do not use personal kubeconfig
2. Regularly **rotate credentials** to avoid certificate expiration causing connection interruptions
3. Ensure the service account has **necessary and minimal RBAC permissions**

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Regularly check** cluster connection status, ensuring all clusters are in Ready state
2. **Configure resource alerts** to notify administrators when CPU/memory/GPU usage exceeds thresholds
3. **Monitor cluster events**, especially Warning-type events that may indicate potential issues

## Permission Requirements

| Operation | Required Role |
|-----------|---------------|
| View Cluster List | System Administrator |
| Add Cluster | System Administrator |
| Test Connection | System Administrator |
| Publish/Unpublish | System Administrator |
| kubectl Terminal | System Administrator |
| Edit Cluster | System Administrator |
| Delete Cluster | System Administrator |
