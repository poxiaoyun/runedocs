## Three Sub-Products

### Rune — AI Workbench

Rune is the platform's core compute engine, designed for ML engineers and data scientists, providing rich AI workload management capabilities:

| Module | Description | Typical Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Inference Service** | One-click deployment of trained models with automatic GPU resource allocation and RESTful API endpoint exposure | Deploy large language models like LLaMA, ChatGLM for online inference |
| **Fine-tuning Service** | Submit SFT/LoRA fine-tuning tasks based on pre-trained models and track training metrics | Fine-tune base models with private data for domain adaptation |
| **Dev Environment** | Launch JupyterLab / VS Code Server / SSH remote development environments with direct GPU access | Interactive model code debugging and data exploration |
| **Application Management** | Deploy and manage custom AI applications (e.g., web demos, API services) | Deploy Gradio/Streamlit demo applications |
| **Experiment Management** | Track ML experiment parameters, metrics, and artifacts; compare different experiments | Record multi-round hyperparameter search results and select optimal configurations |
| **Evaluation Management** | Perform systematic benchmark evaluations on models | Evaluate model accuracy/latency using standard evaluation datasets |

| **App Market** | Platform-provided application template library with one-click deployment | Quickly deploy mainstream frameworks like vLLM, TGI, LLaMA-Factory |

> 💡 **Tip**: All workload types (inference, fine-tuning, dev environments, applications, experiments, evaluations) share a unified deployment workflow: select template → configure parameters → choose flavor → submit deployment. Differences between types are reflected in available templates and parameter configurations.

### Moha — Model Hub

Moha is the platform's built-in AI asset repository, providing a HuggingFace-like model/dataset/Space management experience, but designed for enterprise private deployment:

| Module | Description | Typical Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|

| **Space** | Online showcase space supporting Gradio/Streamlit and other frontend application hosting | Create model experience demos or interactive documentation |
| **Organization Management** | Manage repositories and members at the organization level with role assignment | Divide model asset ownership by team/department |
| **Discussions & PRs** | Community-style discussions, code reviews, and merge requests | Model version review and merge management |
| **Mirror Sync** | Automatically sync models and datasets from external sources (HuggingFace/ModelScope, etc.) | Automatically sync public models to enterprise intranet |
| **Favorites & Ratings** | Model/dataset favoriting and rating system | Help teams discover high-quality internal models |

> 💡 **Tip**: Every Moha repository (model/dataset/Space) has an independent Git repository supporting Git LFS for large file storage, operable via Web UI or command line.

### ChatApp — Conversational Experience

ChatApp provides business users and developers with a ready-to-use large model chat interface, allowing them to experience deployed AI models without writing any code:

| Module | Description | Typical Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **AI Chat Experience** | Select a model and API Key to have streaming conversations with AI, supporting deep thinking (CoT) | Business users experiencing privately deployed large models |
| **Chat Debugging** | Left-side parameter panel + right-side chat area with real-time adjustment of Temperature/TopP/MaxTokens and other parameters | Developers tuning prompts and parameters for optimal output |
| **Multi-Model Comparison** | Side-by-side dual-column chat, sending the same input to two models simultaneously for output quality comparison | Evaluating answer quality across different models (or different versions) |
| **Token Management** | Manage personal or team API access tokens with usage limits and IP whitelisting | Control API call frequency and access scope |

> 💡 **Tip**: ChatApp's conversation parameters include Temperature (0-1.999), Top P (0.1-1.0), Max Tokens (0-32768), System Prompt, and Stop Words. It also supports Deep Thinking (Reasoning) mode, displaying the model's reasoning chain during streaming responses.
