# Space Apps

## Overview

Spaces are hosted web applications that run within the Moha platform. They are ideal for creating interactive demonstrations of your models — think HuggingFace Spaces. You can build a Gradio, Streamlit, or any other web app and deploy it directly from your Space repository.

## Navigation
