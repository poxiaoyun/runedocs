# Evaluation Management

## Feature Overview

Evaluation Management is a feature module in the Rune platform for systematic performance evaluation of AI models. After model training or fine-tuning, users need to measure model performance across different tasks through standardized benchmarks, such as language understanding, reasoning ability, code generation, knowledge Q&A, etc. The evaluation management service automates and visualizes this process.

Evaluation management services belong to the `category=evaluation` category in the Instance architecture, sharing the same underlying instance model and deployment mechanism with inference, fine-tuning, and experiment services. Benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and result displays are all provided by the template-embedded web application, allowing users to view and compare evaluation results intuitively through the Web UI.

### Core Capabilities

- **Template-Driven Deployment**: One-click deployment of evaluation tools (such as OpenCompass, lm-evaluation-harness, etc.) based on Helm Chart templates
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Supports various evaluation benchmarks and metric types for comprehensive model capability assessment
- **Web Visualization**: View evaluation results, compare model performance through template-embedded web applications
- **Automated Workflow**: System automatically executes evaluations and generates reports after configuring evaluation parameters
- **Full Lifecycle Management**: Supports create, start, stop, delete, and other full lifecycle operations

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| ID (Name) | Text | ✅ | K8s resource name, only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, 1-63 characters |

| Template | Select | ✅ | Evaluation template (OpenCompass / lm-eval, etc.) |
| Template Version | Select | ✅ | Template version number |
| Flavor | Select | ✅ | Compute resource specification; evaluating large models typically requires GPU |
| Storage Volume | Select | — | Persistent storage for saving evaluation data and results |

### Template Parameter Configuration

Template parameters are dynamically rendered through SchemaForm. Common evaluation parameter categories include:

| Parameter Category | Example Parameters | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Model Configuration | `model_path`, `model_name` | Path or name of the model to evaluate |
| Datasets | `datasets`, `benchmark_suite` | Evaluation datasets or benchmark suites |
| Evaluation Settings | `batch_size`, `num_fewshot` | Inference batch size, few-shot example count |
| Output Configuration | `output_dir`, `report_format` | Result output directory and report format |
| Environment Variables | Custom key-value pairs | Additional environment variables |

> ⚠️ Note: Evaluating large language models typically requires loading the full model into GPU memory. Please select a sufficiently large GPU flavor based on model parameter count. For example, evaluating a 70B model typically requires at least 4×A100 80G.

## Viewing Evaluation Results via Web UI

![Evaluation Results Web UI](/screenshots/console/evaluation-webui.png)

### Results Overview

- **Overall Score/Ranking**: Model's comprehensive score across benchmarks
- **Dimension Scores**: Detailed scores by knowledge, reasoning, code, math, and other dimensions
- **Radar Chart**: Visual comparison of multi-dimensional capabilities

### Model Comparison

Multiple model evaluation results can be compared in the Web UI:

1. Select models to compare (at least 2)
2. View side-by-side score comparison across dimensions
3. View detailed performance differences on each benchmark dataset
4. Export comparison reports

> 💡 Tip: It is recommended to run evaluations before and after fine-tuning, and measure fine-tuning effectiveness by comparing score changes. If scores decrease in certain dimensions, there may be a "Catastrophic Forgetting" issue.

## Best Practices

### Evaluation Strategy

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Always retain evaluation results from the baseline model (original model without fine-tuning) as a reference for fine-tuning effectiveness
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluate not only fine-tuning task-related metrics but also monitor whether capabilities in other dimensions have decreased
3. **Multi-Round Evaluation**: For different checkpoints during the fine-tuning process, evaluate separately to observe training trends
4. **Unified Environment**: Ensure different evaluations use the same evaluation template and version to guarantee result comparability

### Resource Planning

- Evaluations typically require GPU resources for model inference but don't need the same resource level as training
- For large-parameter models, quantized versions (e.g., INT8/INT4) can be used for evaluation to reduce resource requirements
- It is recommended to schedule evaluation tasks separately from inference services to avoid resource contention

### Result Analysis

- Focus on both absolute scores and relative rankings, comparing with published Leaderboard results
- Analyze performance differences across difficulty-level subsets to identify weaknesses and optimize accordingly
- Retain evaluation configuration and data version information to ensure result reproducibility

> ⚠️ Note: Evaluation results from different evaluation tools and versions may not be fully comparable. When comparing models, ensure the same evaluation template and configuration are used.
