# Workspace Management

## Feature Overview

Workspace is the smallest resource isolation unit in the Rune platform and the basic operational scope for users' daily AI workload usage. Each workspace is bound to a specific **Tenant** and **Cluster**, and has an independent Kubernetes Namespace, achieving complete isolation of resources, permissions, and networking.

In the multi-tenant architecture, organizations use tenants to divide different business lines or departments. Each tenant can create multiple workspaces across multiple clusters. All resources within a workspace — inference services, fine-tuning tasks, dev environments, applications, storage volumes, etc. — run in their independent namespace without interference.

### Core Capabilities

- **Resource Isolation**: Each workspace binds to an independent K8s Namespace, achieving compute, storage, and network isolation
- **Member Management**: Independent member and role system with fine-grained permission control
- **Quota Management**: Allocate resource quotas from tenant level down to workspace level
- **Context Switching**: Quick switching between different workspaces through the top context selector
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete create, edit, delete lifecycle operations

## Create Workspace

### Steps

1. Click the **Create** button in the upper right corner of the list page
2. Fill in workspace information
3. Submit creation

![Create Workspace](/screenshots/console/workspace-create.png)

### Form Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Text | ✅ | Workspace display name, supports Chinese characters, for UI display |
| ID | Text | ✅ | Workspace unique identifier, only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens |
| Cluster | Select | ✅ | Target cluster for the workspace |
| Description | Text Area | — | Description of workspace purpose |

### Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Tenant Admin
    participant Console as Console
    participant API as API Server
    participant K8s as Kubernetes

    Admin->>Console: Fill Workspace Form
    Console->>API: POST /workspaces
    API->>K8s: Create Namespace
    K8s-->>API: Namespace Ready
    API->>K8s: Initialize RBAC / Resource Quota
    API-->>Console: Return Workspace Info
    Console-->>Admin: Display Creation Success
```

> ⚠️ Note: The workspace ID cannot be modified once created — it will be used as part of the K8s Namespace name. Please use meaningful and concise naming, such as `nlp-team`, `cv-prod`.

> 💡 Tip: After creating a workspace, the system automatically creates the corresponding K8s Namespace and initializes necessary RBAC rules. The workspace is ready for use once the status becomes Active.

---

## Resource Isolation Mechanism

Workspaces achieve multi-dimensional resource isolation through Kubernetes Namespaces:

### Isolation Dimensions

| Dimension | Isolation Method | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Compute Resources | ResourceQuota | Limit workspace CPU/GPU/memory usage caps through K8s ResourceQuota |
| Storage Resources | PVC + StorageClass | Each workspace's storage volumes are in independent Namespaces |
| Network Isolation | NetworkPolicy | Network between different workspaces is isolated by default (depends on cluster configuration) |
| Permission Isolation | RBAC | Workspace members can only access resources within their own workspace |
| Instance Isolation | Namespace Isolation | All Instances (inference/fine-tuning/dev/apps, etc.) run in the workspace Namespace |

### Resources Within a Workspace

The following resources all exist within the workspace scope:

```mermaid
graph TB
    WS["Workspace<br/>K8s Namespace"]

    WS --> Inf["Inference Services"]
    WS --> FT["Fine-tuning Tasks"]
    WS --> Dev["Dev Environments"]
    WS --> App["Applications"]
    WS --> Exp["Experiments"]
    WS --> Eval["Evaluations"]
    WS --> PVC["Storage Volumes (PVC)"]
    WS --> Q["Workspace Quota"]
    WS --> M["Workspace Members"]
    WS --> L["Workspace Logs"]

    style WS fill:#e8eaf6
```

| Applications | Total / Running |
| Experiments | Total / Running |
| Evaluations | Total / Running |

---

## Workspace Quota

Manage resource quotas available to the workspace. Quotas are allocated from tenant level down to workspace level.

![Workspace Quota](/screenshots/console/workspace-quota.png)

### Quota List

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Resource Type | CPU / GPU / vGPU / Memory / Storage |
| GPU Model | GPU model (e.g., NVIDIA-A100) |
| Used | Current workspace usage |
| Allocated | Quota cap allocated to the workspace |
| Utilization | Current usage percentage |

### Create/Edit Quota

1. Click the **Create Quota** or the **Edit** button on an existing quota row
2. Select resource type (CPU / GPU / Storage, etc.)
3. Set quota cap value
4. Submit and save

> ⚠️ Note: Workspace quota cannot exceed the tenant's available quota for that cluster. If the tenant quota is insufficient, please contact the platform administrator to increase tenant quota in BOSS.

> 💡 Tip: When workspace resource usage reaches the quota cap, new instance deployment requests will be rejected. Plan quotas wisely and reserve some headroom for burst demands.

---

## Workspace Members

Workspaces independently manage their members and roles for fine-grained permission control.

![Workspace Members](/screenshots/console/workspace-members.png)

### Member List

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Username | Member's username |
| User Info | Display name, email, etc. |
| Role | Role(s) in the workspace (can be multiple) |
| Joined At | Time of joining the workspace |
| Actions | Edit Role / Remove Member |

### Member Roles

| Role | Description | Permission Scope |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| ADMIN | Workspace administrator | All operations: member management, quota management, all instance operations |
| DEVELOPER | Developer | Create, edit, start/stop, delete instances; view quotas and members |
| MEMBER | Regular member | View only: list viewing, detail viewing, no editing permissions |

### Add Member

1. Click the **Add Member** button
2. Search and select a user (from the tenant-level user list)
3. Assign one or more roles
4. Click confirm to add

### Edit Member Role

1. Find the target member in the member list
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Modify role assignments
4. Save changes

### Remove Member

1. Find the target member in the member list
2. Click the **Remove** button
3. Confirm the removal operation

> ⚠️ Note: After removing a member, the user will immediately lose access to all resources within the workspace. Please operate with caution.

### Member API

The platform provides a complete member management API:

| API | Method | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Member List | GET | Get all workspace members |
| Member Details | GET | Get specific member information |
| Update Member | PUT | Modify member roles and other information |
| Delete Member | DELETE | Remove member from workspace |
| Role List | GET | Get available roles for the workspace |

---

## Workspace Switching

In daily use, users may belong to multiple workspaces. The platform enables quick workspace switching through the context provider (`useWorkspaceContext`).

### Switching Methods

1. **Top Navigation Bar**: Click the workspace selector in the top bar, select the target workspace from the dropdown list
2. **Direct URL Access**: Jump directly by modifying the workspace parameter in the URL

### Switching Behavior

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Selector as Workspace Selector
    participant Context as WorkspaceContext
    participant Page as Page

    User->>Selector: Select New Workspace
    Selector->>Context: Update Context
    Context->>Page: Trigger Page Refresh
    Page->>Page: Reload Resources for Corresponding Workspace
    Page-->>User: Display New Workspace Content
```

> 💡 Tip: After switching workspaces, all feature modules in the left navigation (inference, fine-tuning, dev environments, etc.) will automatically load resource data from the new workspace. The context selector also shows region/cluster selection — ensure the cluster selection matches the workspace.

## K8s Namespace Binding

Each workspace automatically binds a Kubernetes Namespace when created, with the following internal properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| tenant | Associated tenant identifier |
| cluster | Associated cluster identifier |
| namespace | K8s Namespace name |
| status.phase | Workspace status phase (Active / Creating / Failed / Terminating) |
| status.message | Status additional information, showing reason when status is abnormal |

### Namespace Naming Rules

The system automatically generates the Namespace name based on tenant ID and workspace ID to ensure global uniqueness. Users do not need to manually manage Namespaces.

---

## Workspace Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Creating: Create Workspace
    Creating --> Active: Namespace Ready
    Creating --> Failed: Initialization Failed
    Active --> Active: Edit/Manage
    Active --> Terminating: Delete Workspace
    Failed --> Creating: Retry Creation
    Terminating --> [*]: Resource Cleanup Complete
```

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Creating | System is creating K8s Namespace and initializing RBAC rules |
| Active | Workspace ready, available for normal use |
| Failed | Creation failed, check error message |
| Terminating | Deleting workspace and all resources underneath |

> ⚠️ Note: Deleting a workspace will simultaneously delete **all resources** underneath it, including inference services, fine-tuning tasks, dev environments, applications, storage volumes, etc. This operation is irreversible — please confirm before executing.

---

## Best Practices

### Workspace Planning

1. **Divide by Team**: Create a workspace for each independent team for easier member management and resource accounting
2. **Divide by Environment**: Use separate workspaces for production and development to prevent experimental workloads from affecting production services
3. **Divide by Project**: Large projects can create dedicated workspaces to centrally manage all AI resources for the project

### Member Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only assign necessary roles to users, avoiding excessive authorization
2. **Regular Review**: Periodically check the member list and promptly remove users who no longer need access
3. **Role Layering**: Workspace administrators handle resource and member management, developers handle specific AI tasks

### Quota Management

1. **Allocate Reasonably**: Distribute quotas based on actual team needs, avoiding over-concentration or over-dispersion
2. **Monitor Utilization**: Regularly monitor quota utilization and expand capacity when utilization is too high
3. **Reserve Buffer**: Reserve 10-20% quota headroom for burst tasks

### Naming Conventions

- Workspace IDs should use the format: `{team}-{environment}`, e.g., `nlp-dev`, `cv-prod`
- Short, meaningful, all lowercase, avoid special characters
