## Capacity Monitoring

Storage volume capacity usage is monitored through Prometheus metrics:

- **Used Capacity**: Total size of all files in the storage volume
- **Total Capacity**: Allocated capacity limit of the storage volume
- **Utilization Rate**: Used capacity / total capacity percentage
- **File Count**: Total number of files in the storage volume

> 💡 Tip: When utilization exceeds 80%, it is recommended to promptly expand capacity or clean up files that are no longer needed to avoid write failures.

## Troubleshooting

### Storage Volume Creation Failed

1. **Check Name Format**: Confirm the name complies with K8s naming convention (1-63 characters, only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens)
2. **Check Storage Cluster**: Confirm the target storage cluster is available and has sufficient capacity
3. **Check Quota**: Confirm the workspace's storage quota is sufficient

### File Upload Failed

- Check if file size exceeds the limit
- Confirm network connection is stable
- Check if remaining storage volume capacity is sufficient
- Try refreshing the page and re-uploading

### Storage Task Failed

- **Git Clone Failed**: Check if repository URL is correct and authentication credentials are valid
- **HuggingFace Download Failed**: Check if repo ID is correct, Token has permissions, and network is reachable
- **ModelScope Download Failed**: Similar to HuggingFace, check authentication and network
- **Python Environment Configuration Failed**: Check if requirements format is correct and package versions are compatible

### Cannot Write After Mounting to Instance

- Confirm whether the storage volume is set to read-only mode
- Check mount path permission settings
- Confirm the user in the instance has write permissions

---

## Best Practices

- **Plan Capacity Wisely**: Estimate capacity based on storage content. For example, a 7B parameter model is approximately 13-15GB (FP16), a 70B parameter model is approximately 130-140GB
- **Use Type Labels**: Set the correct models / datasets type for storage volumes for categorized management and quick selection during deployment
- **Write README**: Write a README.md for each storage volume documenting source, version, format, and other information
- **Clean Up Regularly**: Delete unneeded model checkpoints and temporary files to free storage space
- **Leverage S3 API**: For batch operations on large numbers of files, use S3 accounts through tools like `rclone`, `s3cmd` for higher efficiency
- **Avoid Frequent Resizing**: Since capacity can only increase and not decrease, reserve adequate space during creation
- **Use Read-Only Mode to Protect Data**: Set shared model weights and other important data to read-only mode to prevent accidental modification
- **Use Storage Tasks for Data Import**: Prioritize automated import through storage tasks over manual upload of large files for better stability
