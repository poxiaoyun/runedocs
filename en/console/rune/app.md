# App Management

## Feature Overview

App Management is a feature module in the Rune platform for deploying and managing various AI application instances. Unlike inference services (focused on model inference APIs) and fine-tuning services (focused on model training), App Management provides more general application deployment capabilities, supporting one-click deployment of various web applications, tool services, and custom workloads through the template market.

App Management services belong to the `category=app` category in the Instance architecture, sharing the same underlying instance model and deployment mechanism with inference, fine-tuning, experiment, and evaluation services. The app detail page provides an additional **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) list** on top of standard instance information for managing application persistent storage.

### Core Capabilities

- **Template-Driven Deployment**: Select templates from the App Market for one-click deployment of various AI applications
- **Persistent Storage**: Manage application data persistence through PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
- **Web Access**: Access application web interface via URL after deployment
- **Full Lifecycle**: Supports create, start, stop, edit, delete operations
- **Multi-Dimensional Monitoring**: Integrated Prometheus monitoring panel, log viewer, and K8s event stream

![Deploy Application](/screenshots/console/app-create.png)

### Basic Information Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| ID (Name) | Text | ✅ | K8s resource name, only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, 1-63 characters |
| Display Name | Text | ✅ | Human-readable name for the instance, may include Chinese characters |
| Template | Select | ✅ | Application deployment template |
| Template Version | Select | ✅ | Template version number |
| Flavor | Select | ✅ | Compute resource specification (choose CPU or GPU flavor based on application needs) |
| Storage Volume | Select | — | Persistent storage volume for saving application data |

### Template Parameter Configuration

Template parameters are dynamically rendered through SchemaForm. Configurable parameters vary by selected template. Common parameters include:

| Parameter Category | Example Parameters | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| App Settings | `admin_username`, `admin_password` | Application initial admin account |
| Network Config | `port`, `ingress_enabled` | Service port and exposure method |
| Database | `database_url`, `redis_url` | External database connection configuration |
| Environment Variables | Custom key-value pairs | Additional application runtime parameters |

> ⚠️ Note: Before deploying an application, confirm that the selected flavor has sufficient resource quota. If GPU is needed (e.g., AI drawing applications), select a GPU-enabled flavor.

## Application Detail Page

Click the application name to enter the detail page to view the following information:

### Basic Information

- **Instance Name**: K8s resource name and display name
- **Status**: Current running status
- **Template Info**: Template name and version used
- **Flavor**: Allocated compute resources (CPU / Memory / GPU)
- **Access URL**: Web URL exposed by the application
- **Created/Updated Time**: Lifecycle timestamps

### PVC List (Persistent Volume Claims)

The app detail page features a unique **PVC List** (InstancePVCList) displaying all persistent volume claims associated with the application:

![App PVC List](/screenshots/console/app-pvc-list.png)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| PVC Name | K8s name of the persistent volume claim |
| Status | Bound / Pending / Lost |
| Capacity | Storage capacity requested by the PVC |
| Storage Class | StorageClass used |
| Access Mode | ReadWriteOnce / ReadWriteMany |
| Created At | PVC creation time |

> 💡 Tip: PVC lifecycle is independent of the application instance. When deleting an application, you can choose whether to retain associated PVC data. This is very useful in scenarios where application data needs to be preserved (such as database files, uploaded files, etc.).

### Pod List

Displays all Kubernetes Pods associated with the application instance:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Pod Name | K8s Pod name |
| Status | Running / Pending / Failed, etc. |
| Node | K8s node where the Pod is running |
| Restart Count | Container restart count |
| Created At | Pod creation time |

### Monitoring and Logs

- **Monitoring Panel**: Prometheus/Grafana-style instance monitoring panel displaying CPU, memory, network, and other metrics
- **Log Viewer**: Supports real-time and historical log queries with LogQL syntax

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Installed: Click Deploy
    Installed --> Healthy: Pod Ready
    Installed --> Failed: Deployment Failed
    Healthy --> Unhealthy: Pod Abnormal
    Unhealthy --> Healthy: Pod Recovery
    Healthy --> Degraded: Partial Abnormal
    Degraded --> Healthy: Full Recovery
    Healthy --> Installed: Stop and Restart
    Healthy --> [*]: Delete
    Failed --> [*]: Delete
    Failed --> Installed: Retry Deployment
```

### Lifecycle Operations

| Operation | Description | Prerequisites |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Deploy | Create a new application instance | Sufficient resource quota |
| Start | Start a stopped application | Application is stopped |
| Stop | Stop a running application, release compute resources | Application is running |
| Edit | Modify application parameters or flavor | — |
| Delete | Delete application instance | — |

> ⚠️ Note: Stopping an application releases CPU/GPU compute resources, but PVC data is preserved. After restarting, the application can continue using previous persistent data.

## PVC Management Best Practices

### When to Use PVC

- **Database Applications**: Need to persist database files
- **File Management Applications**: Need to save user-uploaded files
- **Stateful Services**: Need to restore state after restart
- **Shared Data**: Multiple application instances need to share data (use ReadWriteMany mode)

### PVC Capacity Planning

| Application Type | Recommended Capacity | Description |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Data Labeling Tools | 50-200 Gi | Store labeling data and uploaded raw data |
| Visualization Tools | 10-50 Gi | Store logs and cache |
| Model Registry | 200-1000 Gi | Store model weight files |
| General Web Applications | 10-50 Gi | Store configuration and runtime data |

> 💡 Tip: PVC capacity typically cannot be reduced after creation. It is recommended to allocate adequate space during planning. If using a StorageClass that supports dynamic expansion, capacity can be increased on demand later.
